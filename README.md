# hashinimiryala-task2
This repository contains my analysis for Task 2 of the cybersecurity internship. I explored a real phishing URL, identified indicators such as fake login pages, suspicious domains, and urgent messaging, and summarized my findings in a PDF report. The project improves awareness of phishing tactics and strengthens threat analysis skills.
